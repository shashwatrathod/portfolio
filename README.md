## 🚀 About Me

📌 Boston, USA

🟢 Open for relevant Internships and Co-op opportunities throughout the USA.

I am a **software development** enthusiast who is currently pursuing **MS in Computer Science** from Northeastern University in Boston, USA. I have been passionate about tech ever since I got my first smartphone back in 2015 which I rooted (and consequently, bricked :/).

I have learnt and applied concepts from various CS domains like **AI**, **Android**, **Software Development** and even **Embedded Systems** into small and big projects I undertook over the years individually as well as in a team. I find my predilection towards Software Dev rather **special** though. I am always in search of making _meaningful contributions in any organisation_ alongside more like-minded people.

When I'm not coding, I spend my time playing CS:GO and watching documentries about the universe and aviation🤓.
